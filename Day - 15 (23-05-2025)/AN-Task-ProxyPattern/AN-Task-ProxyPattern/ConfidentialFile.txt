How does Proxy pattern work?
 1) Define an interface that both the real object and the proxy implement.

 2) The client interacts with the proxy using this interface.

 3) The proxy holds a reference to the real object.

When a method is called on the proxy, it decides:

Whether to forward the call to the real object,

Or to deny access or provide a substitute result,

Or perform extra actions before/after calling the real object.
